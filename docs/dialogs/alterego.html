    <h4>I owe you a confession</h4>
    <p>
      The design of this website was heavily inspired by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://gaborivan.com/">his</a>
      website. It's not a copy, it's a remake. I did not steal any single code from his site. I used my own knowledge to re-create the
      look and feel, and yet to be completely different under the hood. I can do it. I am a web developer.
