<h3>Long</h3>

<p>
    I started my career right after the university in 2004 at a small digital printing studio. I developed their website
    as well as the online portal of their closest business partner. I learned a lot not only in web development but also
    picked up some useful knowledge in the digital printing.
</p>
<p>
    In 2005 in jumped into the deep water and get a job at Hungary's largest creative/media agency the Carnation Inc.
    There I became a part of the team, and worked and learned hard to hit the same level as the professionals there. I
    met some really great guys there and I will always remember those years as the most intense period of my life.
</p>
<p>
    But unfortunately in 2008 I won the "<em>Worst timing to get a loan</em>" contest that hit my existence very hard, and caused
    depression and gray hairs. It also affected negatively my mood and motivation in my beloved company, and I needed an
    environmental change to get out from the ditch.
</p>
<p>
    So in 2011 I got a web developer job at Docler Holding, which is the mother company of the world's biggest adult
    streaming website. I have to write this, because everybody makes jokes and asks annoying questions: Yes, that adult.
    No, the performances were not held in the building. No, there were no naked girls around us. No, we didn't watched
    the streams during work. We were programming there. We worked on the desktop website, the mobile website, and we took
    care the streams only in technical perspective.
</p>
<p>
    In 2013 the company changed its strategy and decided to move the whole development department to Luxembourg. Because
    the package the company offered was not good enough to live in one the world's most expensive city AND to pay my loan
    that anchored me to Hungary and hooked around my neck like a rope, I decided to look for other opportunities.
</p>
<p>
    I applied for several jobs in England and in Germany (however I couldn't even speak German at all), I also went to
    London for 3 days, because a recruiter arranged some interviews. Ahh, do you remember those pre-Covid times with the
    personal meetings? So on my last day in London one of the German start-ups called me - actually they called the
    recruiter who called me - that they liked the Skype interview with me and also I passed their coding test, so if I
    want the job, it's mine.
</p>
<p>
    This is how I moved to Germany on 1<sup>st</sup> of January in 2014, and started my career in this small but amazing
    Bavarian e-commerce company: <a href="https://westwing.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Westwing</a>.
    And since then I work there, programming behind the scenes as a member of huge international team. And meanwhile that
    small start-up became a real big player in the European e-commerce world.

<h4>What is the conclusion?</h4>
<p>
    I can say without arrogance, that I am a reliable, a good team-worker, self-study guy, and I am loyal to the
    company I work for until I am welcomed and I feel good there.
