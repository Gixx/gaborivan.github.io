<h3>WorstPractice Project</h3>

<p>
    For a long time now I always felt I want to shout out to the world all the crazy ideas I have in my mind. But I know
    that I am too shy to present them with big face and laud voice. I would never be able stand in front of other people
    to a speak abut technical topics. I am not a telling man. I won't be followed by millions, not even tens. I donâ€™t
    feel empowered to talk about <strong>best practices</strong>. But I still want to share my experiences.
</p>

<p>
    This is how the <strong><a href="https://worstpractice.dev/" target="_blank">Worst Practice</a></strong> project was born.
    The name is protecting me. The humor, the sarcasm and self-criticism in the articles are protecting me. The worst thing
    can happen is, I write something really bullshit, that is - true to its name - a worst practice.
