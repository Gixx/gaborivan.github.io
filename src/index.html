<p>In the beginning I was drawing on paper with pencil. I loved to do that. I was a pretty good amateur.</p>
<p>
    Then I wanted to share them on this "new" thing called the Internet. So I learned the basics of
    <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.
</p>
<p>
    Then I wanted to move out from the static world, and wanted to add some dynamics to my online creatures, so I
    started to learn programming. I found my path in the Web Development. My passion became my profession.
    Although, I didn't share any of my drawings in the Internet...

<p>
    I live in Aystetten and work in Home Office for a company in München, Germany since 2014.
    Before that, I spent a dozen of years in different companies in Hungary as a web developer.

    I can show my best skills, when I find a task that fires my interest up to a level where I will focus 100% on the
    task and recognize no time nor hunger.
